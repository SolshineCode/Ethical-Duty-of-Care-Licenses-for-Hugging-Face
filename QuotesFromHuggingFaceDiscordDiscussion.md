Sure there could be licenses that could enforce "best practices" as in "ethical practices" maybe but that needs to be defined well: why would someone who is within a country that has an AI law (AI Act) would care about ethics as long as he follows the law?

CalebSol replied:
```
Because:
(1) the developers of the technology wish to only allow it's use publicly within the ethical parameters defined in a way they agree. This is quintessential to the nature of licenses: they define the intention of the rights holder(s)  in how the innovation can be used by others, expressing their freedom to define their rights. This is especially appealing to developers who have personal or demographic experience of being marginalized or colonized.
(2) The ability for developers to define their own terms of public engagement with their technology encourages open sourcing of technologies which may have otherwise not been made open source, either due to the identification with marginalized personal/demographic experiences or other ethical concerns of the developers. This is good for the open source ecosystem and development of the sciences as a whole, bringing in more contributors.
(3) Allowing for community use and opening source, while barring mis-use, creates an avenue to enforceably condifying personal ethical concern in a personalized manner. These licenses thereby address the recurring debate around unifying ethics or expressing diverse ethics in how AI/ML technology is used.
(4) Regulatory bodies often do not express all possible ethical considerations relevant to developers. Further, in cases where they do account for ethical consideration, the history of enforcement shows it to be often lacking in timeliness, resources, and regulator initiative, even extending to regulatory capture. The enforcement of IP licenses overcomes those shortcomings using an approach available to the community as a whole.
(5) IP litigation has historically been a more effective channel to stopping IP misuse, as compared to regulatory enforcement.
